# 🧠 HR AI SaaS - Brainstorming Discussion Framework

## 📋 Discussion Process Overview

This document outlines our collaborative brainstorming process for refining and planning the HR AI SaaS application migration from Azure to Supabase.

## 🎯 Discussion Goals

1. **Validate Ideas**: Check if user ideas exist in the current migration guide
2. **Identify Gaps**: Find missing features or requirements
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Go back and forth until we have a complete plan
4. **Documentation**: Update the migration guide with agreed changes

## 🔄 Discussion Workflow

### Step 1: User Presents Idea
- User shares a feature, requirement, or modification idea
- Can be new functionality, changes to existing features, or architectural decisions

### Step 2: Claude Analysis
- **SEARCH**: Check if the idea exists in `SUPABASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- **REPORT**: 
  - ✅ **Found**: "This idea is already covered in section X..."
  - ❌ **Missing**: "This idea is not in the current plan..."
  - 🔄 **Partial**: "Similar idea exists but needs modification..."

### Step 3: User Decision
- **If Found**: User can modify, approve, or request changes
- **If Missing**: User says "put it" to add to the plan
- **Continue**: Move to next idea or dive deeper

### Step 4: Documentation Update
- Add new ideas to migration guide
- Modify existing sections as needed
- Update implementation details

## 🎭 Discussion Examples

### Example 1: Existing Feature
**User**: "I want bulk PDF upload functionality"
**Claude**: "✅ **Found**: This is already covered in lines 16, 804-838. The current plan supports up to 500 files per user with 1MB each, queue-based processing at 50-60 files/minute."

### Example 2: Missing Feature
**User**: "I want email notifications when processing completes"
**Claude**: "❌ **Missing**: Email notifications aren't in the current plan. I see notification_email field in the database (line 106) but no implementation details."
**User**: "put it"
**Claude**: *Adds email notification system to the migration guide*

### Example 3: Modification
**User**: "I want to increase file limit to 1000 files"
**Claude**: "🔄 **Partial**: Current limit is 500 files (line 16). This would require updating the processing queue capacity and possibly the UI."
