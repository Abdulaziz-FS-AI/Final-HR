# HR Management System - Development Guidelines

## Project Overview
HR management system being migrated from Azure to Supabase backend.

## Critical Development Rules
- **ALWAYS PLAN**: Use TodoWrite tool for every task to track progress
- **READ BEFORE WRITING**: Always examine existing code before making changes
- **NEVER ASSUME**: Research and understand the codebase thoroughly
- **BE CRITICAL**: Think like a pr
ofessional developer, question decisions
- **FOLLOW PATTERNS**: Maintain consistency with existing code style and architecture

## Code Analysis Workflow
1. **Understand Context**: Read surrounding files and imports
2. **Check Dependencies**: Verify what libraries/frameworks are already in use
3. **Follow Conventions**: Match existing naming, structure, and patterns
4. **Security First**: Never expose secrets, follow best practices
5. **Test Everything**: Verify changes work as expected

## Development Workflow

### Before Starting Any Task
1. Use TodoWrite to plan the task
2. Read and understand existing code
3. Check dependencies and imports
4. Verify patterns and conventions
5. Research best practices for the technology stack

### Quality Standards
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Implement proper error handling
- Add appropriate type definitions
- Test functionality thoroughly
- Never commit secrets or sensitive data


## Notes for Claude
- Always use TodoWrite for task management
- Read existing code before making changes
- Never assume technology choices - investigate first
- Follow security best practices
- Maintain consistency with existing patterns
- Test thoroughly before marking tasks complete
